B"H
Okay, let's break down this Sicha (discourse) by the Rebbe. The goal is to understand the Rebbe's deep dive into a specific law from Maimonides (the Rambam) about bringing offerings in the Temple, and how it reveals a profound message about our relationship with G-d in everything we do.

**The Starting Point: A Law from Maimonides (Rambam)**

The Sicha begins by quoting the Rambam in his great code of Jewish law, the *Mishneh Torah*, specifically in the section called *Hilchos Issurei Mizbeach* – the Laws of Things Forbidden on the Altar.

1.  **Context:** The Rambam has just finished listing different types of olive oil, ranked by quality. The very best quality was required for the Menorah (the great Candelabrum in the Temple). Then he states that for *Mincha* offerings (meal offerings, often brought by people who couldn't afford animal offerings), *all* types of kosher olive oil are acceptable.
2.  **The Specific Law:** Right after this, the Rambam poses a question and answers it in a separate, distinct Halacha (law):
    *   **Question:** "Since all [these types of oil] are valid for meal offerings, why were they listed [by quality]?" If any kosher oil works for a *Mincha*, why bother telling us which is best, second best, etc.?
    *   **Answer:** "So that one may know the best, the average, and the lesser quality. Because **one who wishes to acquire merit for himself should overcome his evil inclination and be generous, bringing his offering from the finest and most excellent of its kind.**"
    *   **Proofs & Extension:** The Rambam then provides proofs for this idea:
        *   Hevel (Abel) brought from the firstborn and finest of his flock, and G-d accepted his offering.
        *   The Torah states, "All fat [certain select fats of an offering] is for G-d." (Leviticus 3:16)
        *   **General Principle:** Rambam concludes: "This applies to **everything done for the sake of the good G-d – it should be from the nicest and the best.** If one builds a house of prayer, it should be finer than his own home. If he feeds the hungry, he should feed them from the best and sweetest of his table. If he clothes the naked, he should clothe them from the finest of his garments. If he consecrates something [to the Temple or charity], he should consecrate the finest of his possessions."

**The Rebbe's First Question: What's New Here?**

The Rebbe immediately asks: This seems puzzling. Why does the Rambam present this as a new Halacha here?

*   **The Problem:** The Rambam himself, *earlier* in the same section of laws (Chapter 7, Halacha 11), already established the rule that offerings must be "from the choice" (*min ha'muvchar*). He derived this from the verse "the choice of your vows" (*Mivchar Nedareichem* - Deut. 12:11). This earlier rule already tells us not to bring blemished or low-quality offerings.
*   **The Question Elaborated:** So, what exactly is the *new* point the Rambam is making in *this specific* Halacha (Chapter 9, Halacha 8)?
    1.  Why is *this* level of "best" specifically derived from the fact that the *oils were listed by quality*?
    2.  Why is *this* level connected to the person's inner desire – "one who *wishes* to acquire merit"?
    3.  Why does Rambam bring *these specific proofs* (Hevel, "All fat is for G-d") for *this* point, rather than relying on the general verse "Mivchar Nedareichem" he used earlier?

**Untangling the Levels of "Best" (The Rebbe's Initial Explanation)**

The Rebbe suggests a straightforward way to understand this initially: There are actually *different levels* of bringing the "best" offering.

1.  **Level 1 (Minimum Standard for Validity):** Based on "Mivchar Nedareichem," certain subtle defects (not full disqualifying blemishes, *mumim*) render an animal unfit for the Altar because it's simply not "choice." (Rambam discusses this in Chapter 2). This is about basic *acceptability*.
2.  **Level 2 (Preferred Standard):** Also based on "Mivchar Nedareichem" or the verse "Cursed be the deceiver who has a [fitting] male in his flock but vows and sacrifices a blemished one" (Malachi 1:14), one shouldn't *intentionally* bring something that's merely "not disqualified" but is still lean, weak, or unattractive (*l'chatchila* - from the outset). You should aim for something decent. However, Rambam elsewhere clarifies (Laws of Sacrificial Procedure 1:12) that if someone vowed "an ox," they don't *have* to bring the absolute fattest, most expensive ox possible – an average one suffices. And if they brought a lean one, they technically fulfilled their vow (after the fact). This level means avoiding the obviously subpar, aiming for average or decent.
3.  **Level 3 (The Ideal - Our Halacha):** The Halacha we're focusing on, at the end of *Hilchos Issurei Mizbeach*, introduces a *higher ideal*. This isn't just about meeting a minimum standard or avoiding the subpar. This is for "one who *wishes* to acquire merit." This person should actively *strive* to bring "the *most* beautiful and praiseworthy," the absolute best possible within that category.
    *   **Key Point:** This highest level, the Rebbe explains, is *not* derived from the basic obligation of "Mivchar Nedareichem." It's derived from the *listing* of the oils (which implies recognizing and choosing the superlative) and is supported by the examples of Hevel (who brought the *very best*) and "Kol Chelev" (the select fats, representing the choicest part given entirely to G-d). It's an *ideal* level of generosity and dedication.

**Reinforcing the Distinction:** The Rebbe notes that Rambam asks "Why were they listed?" *after* he already mentioned the different quality levels of oil earlier (Chapter 9, Halacha 7). If the standard "Mivchar Nedareichem" rule required knowing the absolute best, the question wouldn't make sense – of course, you'd need the list! The fact that Rambam *does* ask this shows that the basic "Muvchar" requirement doesn't mandate the *absolute* best, only something decent. The list's purpose is specifically to guide the person who *wants to go the extra mile* and bring the superlative best.

**The Rebbe's Deeper Questions: Placement and Examples**

Now the Rebbe probes further, based on this understanding:

1.  **Why Here?** If this principle of bringing the "nicest and the best" applies to *everything* done for G-d (building a shul, charity, etc.), as Rambam explicitly states, why is this general rule placed specifically here, in the *Laws of Things Forbidden on the Altar* (*Issurei Mizbeach*)? Logically, it seems like it would belong:
    *   In the Laws of Charity (*Matnos Aniyim*), given the examples of feeding and clothing the poor.
    *   Or perhaps even earlier, in the Laws of Prayer (*Tefillah*), given the example of building a synagogue. Rambam *does* discuss synagogue construction there (e.g., it should be the tallest building in the city) – why didn't he mention this principle ("make it nicer than your house") there?
2.  **Why These Examples?** The Talmud (Shabbos 133b) discusses the concept of *Hiddur Mitzvah* – beautifying commandments – deriving it from the verse "This is my G-d and I will glorify Him" (*Zeh Keli V'anveihu* - Exodus 15:2). The examples given there are: making a beautiful Sukkah, taking a beautiful Lulav and Esrog, using a beautiful Shofar, having nice Tzitzis (fringes), writing a Torah scroll beautifully with fine ink and a skilled scribe, and wrapping it in beautiful silks. Why does Rambam, when illustrating *this* principle, use *different* examples (Shul, charity, dedicating property) and not the classic Talmudic examples of *Hiddur Mitzvah*?

These questions suggest there must be something unique about this principle that connects it specifically to the Altar and distinguishes it from the general concept of beautifying Mitzvot (*Hiddur Mitzvah*).

**Unveiling the Deeper Meaning: The Nature of Offerings vs. Mitzvot**

The Rebbe now reveals the core distinction:

*   **General Mitzvot (Commandments):** When you perform a Mitzvah (like waving a Lulav or putting on Tefillin), the primary focus is on the *person* (*Gavra*) fulfilling G-d's command. The object (*Cheftza*) – the Lulav, the Tefillin – is a tool or means to perform the action. While the object might gain some sanctity (becoming *Tashmishei Mitzvah* - an accessory to a Mitzvah, or *Tashmishei Kedusha* - an accessory of holiness), the main point is the *person's act* of fulfilling the Divine will. The object typically remains the person's property.
*   **Korbanot (Offerings):** Offerings are fundamentally different. The essence (*Geder*) of bringing a *Korban* is about the *offering itself* being dedicated and given over to G-d. It's about *Kedushas HaKorban* – the sanctity of the offering. While the person is also fulfilling a Mitzvah (e.g., fulfilling a vow or obligation), the central focus shifts to the *object* being transferred to the Divine realm. You are *giving this thing* to G-d. This culminates when the offering is placed on the Altar (*Mizbeach*), symbolically becoming G-d's "food." It's the primary way something physical is truly given away *to* G-d.

**Applying the Distinction: *Hiddur Mitzvah* vs. Rambam's Principle**

This explains the difference between the two concepts:

*   ***Hiddur Mitzvah* ("Zeh Keli V'anveihu"):** Beautifying a Mitzvah (like having a beautiful Lulav) is primarily about enhancing the *person's performance* of the command. It's making *your act* of serving G-d more beautiful "before Him" (*Lefanav*). It relates to the *Gavra* (person).
*   **Rambam's Principle ("Bring the very best"):** In the context of *Korbanot*, bringing the "most beautiful and praiseworthy" isn't just about the person making *their action* look good. It's about the *inherent quality of the gift being given to G-d*. It perfects the *offering itself* (*Cheftza*) as something dedicated entirely to the Divine. The focus is on the *completeness and quality of the surrender* of the object to G-d.

**Solving the Placement Puzzle: Why *Issurei Mizbeach*?**

Now it makes sense why Rambam placed this Halacha here:

*   This principle relates to the *essence* of a *Korban* – the act of giving something completely to G-d.
*   The ultimate expression and completion (*Gmar v'Shleimus*) of this giving happens on the *Mizbeach* (Altar), where the offering is consumed and fully transferred to the Divine realm.
*   Therefore, the principle of bringing the *absolute best* – representing the most perfect and complete *giving* – belongs specifically in the laws governing the *Altar*, the focal point of this Divine acceptance. It's intrinsically tied to the function and sanctity of the *Mizbeach*. It defines the highest standard of what is worthy *for the Altar*.

**Solving the Example Puzzle: Why Shul, Charity, Dedication?**

This also explains Rambam's choice of examples:

*   He's not illustrating general *Hiddur Mitzvah* (beautifying the *performance*). He's illustrating things that are analogous to a *Korban* – acts where something is fundamentally *given over* "for the sake of the good G-d."
    *   **Building a House of Prayer / Dedicating Property:** These are acts where property is designated and given "for G-d."
    *   **Feeding the Hungry / Clothing the Naked (Charity):** How does this fit? The Rebbe cites the Rogatchover Gaon (a renowned scholar) who explained that charity (*Tzedakah*) has two aspects: fulfilling a Mitzvah obligation, and also acting as *Kapparah* (atonement), similar to a *Korban*. By phrasing it as "feeding the *hungry*" and "clothing the *naked*", Rambam echoes the prophet Isaiah (Chapter 58) who describes these specific actions as part of repentance and seeking atonement on a fast day. In this context, charity is framed not just as fulfilling an obligation, but as an act of *giving* for atonement, paralleling the function of a *Korban*.

**Integrating the Person and the Offering: The Role of Inner Desire**

So, we see the principle relates deeply to the *offering* itself being given to G-d via the Altar. But Rambam explicitly linked it to the *person* – "one who *wishes* to acquire merit should *overcome his evil inclination* and be generous..." How do these aspects connect?

*   **The Connection:** The very purpose of the offering reaching its completion on the Altar is to bring about *Ritzuy* (acceptance, favor) and *Kapparah* (atonement) for the *person* who brought it.
*   **The Synergy:** Therefore, the *more* the person invests internally – the more they genuinely overcome their stinginess or indifference (*yichof yitzro*), the more generous they are (*virchiv yado*), and the better the quality they bring (*min ha'yafeh ha'meshubach*) – the *more potent* the offering becomes in achieving that acceptance and atonement for them. The quality of the person's inner devotion and generosity directly translates into the spiritual efficacy of the offering facilitated by the Altar. This is how the person "acquires merit for himself" (*l'zakot atzmo*).
*   **Deeper Insight (Ramban):** The Rebbe adds depth by referencing Nachmanides (Ramban), who explains that a *Korban* works as atonement because the person should contemplate that *they* deserved the fate of the animal (its blood spilled, its body consumed) due to their sin. The animal acts as a substitute. This shows that the *person's inner state* – recognizing their fault, subjugating their desires (*yichof yitzro*) – isn't just a side point; it's the very essence of what makes the *Korban* achieve atonement. The act of overcoming the self *is* the core of the offering's reconciling power.

**Why Derive This from the *Mincha* Offering?**

Why did Rambam derive this highest ideal – bringing the absolute best – specifically from the *Mincha* offering (the meal offering, whose oils were listed)?

*   **The Essence of Offering:** The core idea of a *Korban* is self-surrender to G-d. This surrender is most pure and complete when it's done without ego or seeking recognition.
*   **The Poor Person's Offering:** The Talmud (Menachos 104b) famously states that regarding the *Mincha*, G-d says: "Who usually brings a *Mincha*? A poor person. I consider it as if he offered his very soul (*nafsho*) before Me."
*   **The Significance:** Why is the poor person's humble offering considered like offering their soul? Because when bringing this simple offering, the poor person doesn't feel they are doing something grand or impressive. There's no room for ego ("Look at me, the fine Jew, bringing this magnificent offering!"). Instead, their offering comes from a place of genuine humility, brokenheartedness, and true subjugation of the self (*kefiyas ha'yetzer*). This profound, unadulterated self-abnegation *is* the essence of offering one's soul.
*   **The Lesson:** Deriving the principle of bringing the *absolute best* (requiring the greatest effort and generosity – *yichof yitzro v'yirchiv yado*) from the *Mincha* teaches a crucial lesson. This ultimate level of giving stems not from external grandeur, but from the place of utmost sincerity and self-surrender exemplified by the poor person's offering. It highlights that the quality G-d desires most is the complete giving of the self.

**Conclusion: From the Altar to Redemption**

The Rebbe concludes by bringing it all together:

*   Fulfilling this ideal – overcoming the self to give the absolute best to G-d – represents the perfection of the Altar's purpose described in *Hilchos Issurei Mizbeach*.
*   The Altar (*Mizbeach*) achieves complete atonement (*Kapparah*) and acceptance (*Ritzuy*), bringing pleasure (*Nachas Ruach*) to G-d. The Hebrew letters of Mizbeach are interpreted by the Sages (Kesubos 10b) as hinting at its functions: **M**aziach (Removes harsh decrees), **Z**an (Sustains the world), **M**echabev (Endears Israel to G-d), **M**echaper (Atones for sins).
*   When the *cause* of exile – sin (*avonoseinu*) – is fully atoned for through this complete devotion, the *effect* – exile (*galus*) – is automatically nullified.
*   This leads *immediately* (*miyad*) to the ultimate Redemption (*Geulah*) through Mashiach. He will rebuild the Temple and, crucially, the Altar (whose location is exact and essential), gather the dispersed Jews, and usher in an era where our service of G-d reaches its ultimate perfection.

**In Simple Terms:**

The Rebbe is explaining that Maimonides isn't just giving a technical rule about offerings. He's revealing a deep truth: G-d wants us to give our absolute best in anything we do for Him, not just meeting minimum requirements. This isn't just about making our actions "look nice" (like *Hiddur Mitzvah*), but about the *essence* of giving something over *completely* to G-d, paralleling the way an offering was given on the Altar. This requires overcoming our own selfishness and limitations ("subduing the evil inclination"). When we do this – whether building a synagogue, giving charity with the right intention, or any act dedicated to G-d – we are tapping into the power of the Altar, achieving true closeness and atonement. This level of devotion, rooted in sincere self-surrender (like the poor person's *Mincha*), is what ultimately removes the spiritual blockages causing exile and brings the Redemption.
