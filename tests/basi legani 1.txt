Okay, let's break down the Rebbe's first Ma'amar (Chassidic discourse), "Basi Legani 5711," step by step. This discourse is incredibly significant as it was delivered exactly one year after the passing of the previous Rebbe, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn (the Rebbe Rayatz), on the 10th of Shevat, 5711 (1951). It marks the Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson's, formal acceptance of the leadership of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement.

The Rebbe begins by quoting the final discourse delivered by his father-in-law, the Rebbe Rayatz, which also centered on the verse **"Basi Legani Achosi Kallah" - "I have come into My garden, My sister, My bride"** (Song of Songs 5:1).

**The Core Idea from the Previous Rebbe & the Midrash:**

The Previous Rebbe quoted a Midrash (ancient rabbinic commentary) on this verse. The Midrash points out something subtle: the verse says "LeGani" (לגני - *to My garden*), not just "LaGan" (לגן - *to the garden*). The extra "i" (represented by the letter Yud - י) signifies "My." The Midrash explains this means God is saying He returned "LeGnuni" (לגנוני - *to My bridal chamber*), which it identifies as the place where God's presence *originally* dwelled – namely, **"in the lowest realms" (בתחתונים)**. The Midrash states: **"the main dwelling place of the Shechina (עיקר שכינה) was originally in the lowest realms."**

This is the foundational statement the Rebbe sets out to explain.

**Section 1 (א): Understanding "Ikar Shechina" - The Essence of the Divine Presence**

The Rebbe immediately zooms in on the phrase **"Ikar Shechina" (עיקר שכינה)** - the *main*, *essential*, or *primary* dwelling place of the Divine Presence (Shechina).

*   **Question:** Why "Ikar"? Why the emphasis on *main* or *essential*? Isn't God's presence everywhere? Don't higher spiritual worlds have a more revealed sense of Godliness? This seems counter-intuitive. Usually, we think of spiritual light diminishing as it descends into lower realms. Why would the *lowest* realm be the *primary* place?

To understand this, the Rebbe first needs to clarify what "Shechina" itself means.

*   **What is Shechina?** The Rebbe quotes the first Chabad Rebbe, Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi (the Alter Rebbe), who explains that "Shechina" comes from the Hebrew root meaning "to dwell" (שכן - Shachan), as in the verse "And I will *dwell* among them" (ושכנתי בתוכם). The Alter Rebbe identifies Shechina with the **very first revelation of God's infinite light (Ohr Ein Sof)**.

*   **Exploring Different Levels of Shechina:** The Rebbe then shows that "Shechina" can refer to different levels of Divinity, depending on the context:
    *   **Before Creation (Pre-Tzimtzum):** Based on the Alter Rebbe, Shechina refers to the initial revelation of the Infinite Light *before* the Tzimtzum (the primordial "contraction" or "concealment" that made space for creation). The Rebbe Rashab (the 5th Rebbe) elaborated that within the Infinite Light, there's an aspect designated to be the source of the light that *fills* worlds (Ohr Mimalei Kol Almin), and *this* potential is called Shechina even before Tzimtzum.
    *   **After Tzimtzum:** The Mitteler Rebbe (the 2nd Rebbe) explains that relative to God's absolute Essence, even the *Kav* (the "line" or "ray" of Divine light that entered the "vacuum" after the Tzimtzum) can be called Shechina.
    *   **Within the Worlds (Atzilus):** In Rabbinic literature (like the Midrash being discussed), "Shechina" often refers to *Malchus* (Kingship), the lowest of the ten Sefiros (Divine attributes/emanations) in the world of Atzilus (the highest spiritual world). However, the Tzemach Tzedek (the 3rd Rebbe) clarifies that Malchus of Atzilus is only called Shechina when it's acting as the source and conduit of life-force for the lower worlds (Beriah, Yetzirah, Asiyah), specifically when it functions as "Atik" (the "Ancient One," a high level) for the world of Beriah. When it's just within Atzilus, fully united with the other Sefiros, it's not typically referred to as Shechina in this context.
    *   **The Underlying Purpose:** The Rebbe Maharash (the 4th Rebbe) adds another layer: even the highest levels (like the Kav) are called Shechina because their ultimate *purpose* is to eventually descend and dwell within the created worlds and within Jewish souls. The purpose informs the name even at the source.

*   **The Question Returns:** After establishing that Shechina exists at incredibly high spiritual levels, the Rebbe brings back the main question: If Shechina relates to these lofty realms, even pre-dating creation, how can the Midrash say its ***Ikar*** – its primary, essential place – was originally in the ***lowest realms*** (this physical world)? Logically, the higher you go, the more intense the revelation should be. The Rebbe notes the general rule: light diminishes as it descends through the spiritual hierarchy (Seder Hishtalshelus). So, why is the *lowest* point considered the *primary* dwelling?

**Section 2 (ב): The Impact of Sin - Focusing on the Lowest Realm**

The Rebbe now shifts to the Midrash's continuation: after Adam sinned (eating from the Tree of Knowledge), the Shechina withdrew from the lowest realm (Earth) to the first "heaven" (spiritual level). Subsequent sins (Cain, generation of Enosh, etc.) caused further withdrawals, level by level.

*   **The Rebbe's Insight:** The Rebbe highlights that the Midrash focuses on Adam's sin as the *primary* cause of the Shechina's departure from *this physical world*. Just as the *Ikar Shechina* (essence of the Divine Presence) was originally in the lowest world, the ***Ikar HaSiluk*** (the *essential* withdrawal) happened when it left *this world*.
*   **Why Adam's Sin is Unique:** The subsequent sins caused withdrawals from one spiritual level to a higher one. But Adam's sin caused the initial, fundamental break – the departure from the tangible, physical Earth. This is the withdrawal that most directly impacts us and represents the core problem that needs fixing. The Ma'amar text notes that Adam's sin is listed separately from the others (Cain, Enosh, etc.) precisely because its effect (withdrawal from *Earth* to heaven) was qualitatively different and more fundamental than the later withdrawals (from heaven to higher heaven).

**Section 3 (ג): Bringing the Shechina Back Down - The Role of the Seventh**

The Midrash continues: Seven righteous individuals (Tzaddikim) gradually brought the Shechina back down:
1.  Abraham: From the 7th heaven to the 6th.
2.  Isaac: From the 6th to the 5th.
3.  Jacob: From the 5th to the 4th.
4.  Levi: From the 4th to the 3rd.
5.  Kehos: From the 3rd to the 2nd.
6.  Amram: From the 2nd to the 1st.
7.  **Moshe (Moses):** From the 1st heaven **down to Earth.**

*   **Moshe's Special Role:** The Rebbe emphasizes that Moshe, the *seventh* Tzaddik in this sequence, was the one who brought the Shechina *all the way back down to Earth*, specifically at the Giving of the Torah on Mount Sinai. This again reinforces the idea that the *Ikar* (the main point) is about bringing Godliness fully into *this lowest world*.
*   **"All Sevenths are Beloved" (כל השביעין חביבין):** The Rebbe quotes the Talmudic saying that "All sevenths are beloved." He points out the phrasing: it's not "All beloved things are seventh," but "All *sevenths* are beloved." This implies the *belovedness* comes specifically *because* it's the seventh. It's an inherent quality, not necessarily earned through personal striving in the same way as others; it comes "ready-made" (פאַרטיקערהייט) by virtue of its position in the sequence. This is why Moshe was chosen to bring down the Torah.
*   **The Seventh Depends on the First:** The Rebbe then brings a teaching from his father-in-law (delivered upon arriving in America): The special quality of the seventh stems from the *first* (Avraham - Abraham). Avraham's greatness lay in his pioneering work and *Mesiras Nefesh* (self-sacrifice).
*   **Avraham's Unique Self-Sacrifice:** The Rebbe elaborates on Avraham's Mesiras Nefesh. It wasn't like Rabbi Akiva, who actively sought martyrdom ("When will the opportunity come to me so I may fulfill it?"). Avraham's primary mission was to teach the world about God – "He called out there in the name of Hashem, God of the Universe" (וַיִּקְרָא שָׁם בְּשֵׁם ה' אֵ-ל עוֹלָם). The Rabbis interpret "Vayikra" (He called) as "Vayakri" (He caused *others* to call out) – אַז יענער זאָל אויך שרייען (that the other person should also cry out). If, *incidentally* (בדרך אגב), fulfilling this mission required self-sacrifice, Avraham was ready. His focus was outward, on transforming the world.
*   **The Connection:** Moshe's ability to bring the Torah down, despite his inherent "seventh" quality, is rooted in Avraham's foundational work. God even tells Moshe, "Do not stand in the place of the great" (referring to Avraham).
*   **Relevance to Everyone:** While being "seventh" is unique, the Rebbe stresses that the potential to connect with God and achieve spiritual heights is available to *everyone*. We are encouraged to say, "When will my actions reach the actions of my forefathers, Avraham, Yitzchak, and Yaakov?" However, one must remain humble ("Do not stand in the place of the great").
*   **The Task of the Seventh:** The belovedness of the seventh (Moshe) is that he can *implement* the mission of the first (Avraham's "Vayakri"), drawing down not just the Shechina, but the *Ikar Shechina* (the Essence) into the *lowest world* (Tachtonim).
*   **Application to the Present Generation:** The Rebbe then makes a powerful statement: **"This is demanded from each and every one of us, the seventh generation."** He identifies his generation (counting from the Alter Rebbe as the first leader of Chabad) as the seventh. Even though being in this generation isn't based on personal choice or merit, the principle "All sevenths are beloved" applies. This generation, living in the "footsteps of Mashiach," has the specific task of *completing* the work: drawing down the *Ikar Shechina* into the *Tachtonim* – into this physical world.

**Section 4 (ד): The Ultimate Purpose - A Dwelling Place Below**

The Rebbe returns to the idea that the primary revelation of the Shechina (after Moshe brought it down) was in the *Beit Hamikdash* (Holy Temple) and the *Mishkan* (Tabernacle).

*   **"Dwell Among Them":** He cites the verse, "They shall make Me a sanctuary, and I shall dwell *among them* (בתוכם - Besocham)" (Exodus 25:8). The Rabbis famously interpret "Besocham" not as "in it" (the sanctuary), but "within *them*," meaning within each individual Jew.
*   **Righteous Inherit the Land:** He connects this to the verse "The righteous shall inherit the land and dwell forever upon it" (Psalms 37:29). Chassidus explains "land" can refer to the Garden of Eden (Gan Eden), but the deeper meaning is that Tzaddikim "inherit the land" because they *cause God to dwell* (משכינים - Mashkinim, from the same root as Shechina) below. They draw down the One "Who dwells eternally [in the heights]" (שוכן עד) so that He is revealed *below*.
*   **The Core Purpose of Creation:** This brings the Rebbe to the ultimate reason *why* the "Ikar Shechina" was originally below and why bringing it back down is the goal: **"The entire purpose of the creation and chain-like descent (Hishtalshelus) of the worlds is because the Holy One, Blessed be He, desired (נתאוה הקב"ה) to have a dwelling place (דירה) for Himself in the lowest realms (בתחתונים)."** This is a cornerstone concept in Chabad philosophy.
*   **Why the Lowest World?** The Rebbe elaborates on this using the Alter Rebbe's explanation:
    *   The purpose cannot be for the sake of the higher spiritual worlds. For them, the process of creation is actually a *descent*, a dimming of God's infinite light. It doesn't make sense that the purpose of creation would be a step *down* for the highest realms.
    *   Furthermore, creation *ex nihilo* (something from nothing) can only come from God's *Essence* (Atzmus), which is beyond any revelation or manifestation (like the Sefiros or spiritual worlds). The purpose of an act stemming from the Essence must relate back to the Essence itself, not just to lower-level revelations.
*   **The Unique Quality of the Lowest World:** The Rebbe brings the Mitteler Rebbe's explanation (from a discourse on Parshas Beshalach) highlighting the difference between higher worlds and this physical world:
    *   Higher worlds are like light – they clearly point to their source (the Luminary). Their existence screams "I come from something higher!"
    *   This physical world (*Olam HaZeh*) is different. It feels independent, self-sufficient. Its existence *conceals* its Creator. This feeling of "my existence is from myself" (מציאותו מעצמותו) is, paradoxically, its unique virtue.
    *   Why? Because this (illusory) sense of self-existence mirrors, in a way, God's *true* self-existence (His Essence, which truly has no prior cause). The lowest world's ability to *seem* independent stems from its ultimate root in God's Essence.
*   **Conclusion:** Therefore, the purpose of creation isn't the lofty spiritual realms (which are mere "revelations"), but this lowest world. Through our work here – specifically *Etkafya* (אתכפיא - subduing the negative, the ego, the feeling of independence) and *Et'hapcha* (אתהפכא - transforming darkness into light, refining the physical world through Mitzvos) – we reveal the *Essence* of God right here. This transformation makes the lowest world the "dwelling place" God desired.

**Section 5 (ה): Refining the Purpose - Atzilus and Our Work**

The Rebbe addresses potential counter-arguments or complexities:

*   **What about Atzilus?** Even if we consider the *Kelim* (vessels/structures) of the world of Atzilus to be a form of "creation" (as one view holds), it's still not absolute *Yesh Me'ayin* (something from nothing) like our world. It's considered "something from something" relative to the *Reshima* (the "impression" of Divine light remaining after the Tzimtzum). So, Atzilus is still fundamentally about revelation, not the Essence in the same way our world connects to it after refinement.
*   **Mitzvos Adding Light in Atzilus?** We learn that performing Mitzvos adds light and spiritual energy in the higher worlds, particularly Atzilus. Doesn't this imply Atzilus is the goal? The Rebbe quotes the Rebbe Maharash (and references Tanya, Chapter 40, footnote 2): The spiritual energy generated by Mitzvos that ascends to Atzilus is essentially "stored" there (like being "placed in a box" - כמונחים בקופסא). It's not primarily for the benefit *of* Atzilus itself; rather, it's held there *for the sake of the lower world*, to be drawn down and revealed here later.
*   **God's Desire:** The Rebbe Rashab explained that the higher worlds are revelations, which represent a "descent" from God's perspective, and the Essence is separate from them. The true purpose is this lowest world because God specifically desired the *satisfaction* (נחת רוח - Nachas Ruach) that comes "when the 'Other Side' (Sitra Achra - forces of negativity/concealment) is subdued (אתכפיא) and darkness is transformed into light (אתהפכא חשוכא לנהורא)."
*   **Transforming Folly:** The Ma'amar being explained mentions this involves transforming the *Shtus d' לעומת זה* (the "folly" of the profane/mundane world) into *Shtus d'Kedusha* (holy "folly" – supra-rational devotion and commitment).
*   **Making a Dwelling for the Essence:** This work fulfills God's desire ("My Will was done"). It makes this world a "Dirah" (dwelling) for God. Just as a person dwells in their home with their *entire essence*, not just a part of themselves, our work draws God's *Essence* (Atzmus Ein Sof) into this world, not just His revelations. *This* is the ultimate goal.

**Section 6 (ו): The Mishkan's Symbolism and the Rebbes' Example**

The Rebbe connects the theoretical back to the practical and symbolic:

*   **Acacia Wood (עצי שטים):** The Mishkan was built primarily from *Atzei Shittim* (Acacia wood). The word "Shittim" (שטים) is related to the word "Shtus" (שטות - folly, irrationality). This symbolizes the core task: transforming the mundane "folly" and the passionate drive (דעם קאָך) of the Nefesh HaBahamis (Animal Soul) into holy folly – a devotion that transcends logic and reason (עבודה ובטול שלמעלה מטעם ודעת).
*   **The Rebbes Lived It:** The Rebbe makes a crucial point: The Chabad Rebbes didn't just teach these lofty ideas; they embodied them. He quotes the saying about God: "He relates His words to Jacob... What He does, He tells Israel to do and observe." The Rebbes demonstrated this principle. What they demanded of their followers, they first fulfilled themselves.
*   **Examples of the Rebbes' Dedication:** The Rebbe provides poignant examples (many familiar in Chabad lore) of the previous six Rebbes' dedication, particularly in Ahavas Yisrael (Love of fellow Jews) and self-sacrifice for others, often setting aside their own spiritual or physical needs:
    *   **Alter Rebbe:** Left his prayers to chop wood and cook soup for a woman who had just given birth because no one else was there to help.
    *   **Mitteler Rebbe:** Showed his arm to someone complaining about spiritual apathy, saying (paraphrased), "Look how my skin has shriveled from worry... it's because of *your* lack of fervor!" demonstrating profound empathy and connection.
    *   **Tzemach Tzedek:** Went before prayers to arrange a loan for a simple man whose livelihood depended on it.
    *   **Rebbe Maharash:** Traveled specifically from a spa town to Paris to meet a young man and warn him against drinking non-kosher wine ("Yayin Nesech dulls the mind and heart. Be a Jew!"). The young man later sought him out, repented, and established a devout family. This, despite the Rebbe Maharash's time being exceptionally precious.
    *   **Rebbe Rashab:** At the beginning of his leadership, personally traveled to Moscow to deal with a harsh decree, despite his brother (the Raza) offering to go (being more fluent in Russian and having connections), because he felt it was his responsibility.
    *   **Rebbe Rayatz (the Previous Rebbe):** Numerous stories exist of him putting himself out, sacrificing his physical and even spiritual comfort, to help individuals materially or spiritually, even those who were far from his level or antagonistic.
*   **Why Share These Stories?** The Rebbe explains that the Rebbes revealed their actions "so that it would be easier for us to fulfill them." Their example paves the way and empowers their followers.

**Section 7 (ז): Transformation Brings Higher Revelation - Understanding Histalkus**

The Rebbe explains that the work of *Etkafya* and *Et'hapcha* (subduing and transforming) doesn't just restore the world to its original state; it elevates it *higher*.

*   **Building Anew:** He uses the analogy: If you demolish an old building *in order to build a new one*, the new one must surely be better and loftier than the old. Similarly, the "dwelling" created through transformation after sin must be superior to the original state.
*   **Elevated Glory:** How is it higher? The Ma'amar states that through this work, "the glory of the Holy One, Blessed be He, is elevated (אסתלק יקרא דקוב"ה) throughout all the worlds." This "Istalkus" (elevation/withdrawal, but here meaning revelation through elevation) signifies the drawing down of a light that *transcends* the normal order of worlds – a light that affects all realms equally (related to the deeper meaning of *Ohr HaSovèv*, the transcendent light).
*   **Histalkus of a Tzaddik:** The Rebbe connects this concept of "Istalkus" to the passing of a Tzaddik, also called *Histalkus*. He references two letters in the Alter Rebbe's *Iggeres HaKodesh* that discuss this:
    *   One letter connects it to the *Parah Adumah* (Red Heifer). Just as purification from contact with death came via the ashes prepared *outside* the camp, the ultimate spiritual refinements often come through forces seemingly "outside" the normal structure, like the influence of a Tzaddik after their passing.
    *   The passing of Tzaddikim is described as being as grievous as the destruction of the Temple, or even *more* grievous.
*   **The True Meaning of Histalkus:** The Rebbe emphasizes that *all* the Rebbes explained that Histalkus does *not* mean the Tzaddik simply "goes up" and leaves the world. Rather, it means they are still present *below*, but in a state of *elevation* and *transcendence* (רוממות - Romemus). Their influence becomes more pervasive and internalized.
*   **The Demand on the Seventh Generation:** Again, the Rebbe brings it back to his generation: "This is demanded of us, the seventh generation... although we haven't earned it... nevertheless, 'All sevenths are beloved.'" The task is to draw the Shechina down *below, literally*, by transforming the folly and passion of the Animal Soul (which everyone possesses) into holy folly.

**Section 8 (ח): The Purpose of the Tzaddik's Passing and the Mission**

The Rebbe now directly addresses the very event that occasioned this discourse: the *Histalkus* of his father-in-law, the Previous Rebbe ("Tzadika de'itpatar" - the righteous one who has departed).

*   **A Necessary Step:** He explains that even after all the previous concealments, challenges, and difficulties ("קושיות וענינים בלתי מובנים"), the ultimate elevation ("Istalka Yekara d'Kudsha Brich Hu") required the profound event of the Tzaddik's passing, which is "harder even than the destruction of the Temple." The purpose behind this immense difficulty is to bring about the highest revelation.
*   **The Renewed Call to Action:** This deepens the demand on the seventh generation:
    *   Recognize your position as the seventh.
    *   Understand that the seventh's power comes from the first (Avraham).
    *   Emulate Avraham's approach: complete dedication to the mission ("Vayakri"), not seeking personal gain (even spiritual), going into places devoid of Godliness and Judaism ("ניט געוואוסט פון ג-טליכקייט, ניט געוואוסט פון אידישקייט און ניט געוואוסט אפי' פון אלף בית"), setting oneself aside, and making *others* "cry out."
    *   Focus on "El Olam" (אֵ-ל עוֹלָם - God *is* the Universe/Eternity) not just "El *Ha*Olam" (God *of* the world). The goal is to reveal the inherent unity of God and Creation, not just that God is the ruler *over* a separate world. Make the other person scream that Godliness and the world are "כולא חד" (all one).

**Section 9 (ט): Empowerment, Ultimate Goal, and Conclusion**

The Rebbe acknowledges the immense challenge: "Who is he... who would dare say, 'I will perform the service of Avraham Avinu'?"

*   **Empowerment:** But, he immediately pivots: *some aspect* ("אפס קצהו" - the very tip/edge) is relevant and obligatory for *everyone*. And crucially, **we are given the strength** (הכחות) for this by the path paved and the example set by all the Rebbes, culminating in the Previous Rebbe. They forged the way and empowered us. This empowerment *is* the "belovedness" of the seventh generation.
*   **The Result:** Through this work, the *Ikar Shechina* will be drawn down into the physical world, reaching a state *even higher* than before Adam's sin. The Rebbe quotes the idea that Mashiach will be higher ("exalted exceedingly") than even pre-sin Adam.
*   **The Previous Rebbe's Role in Redemption:** The Rebbe connects the Previous Rebbe's suffering (quoting verses from Isaiah 53 often applied to Tzaddikim who suffer for the generation: "He bore our illnesses and carried our pains... wounded for our transgressions...") to the imminent redemption. Just as he shared our suffering, he will soon redeem his flock from spiritual and physical exile, uniting us with God's very *Essence* (מהות ועצמות א"ס ב"ה). This connection to the Essence is the ultimate inner purpose of creation, sin, rectification, and the Histalkus of Tzaddikim.
*   **The Final Redemption:** The Rebbe paints a picture of the Geulah (Redemption), quoting verses about leaving exile "with an uplifted hand," light for the Jews, the future song of Moshe ("Az Yashir Moshe"), and God's eternal kingdom ("Hashem Yimloch Le'Olam Va'ed"). He concludes with the verse signifying ultimate unity: "On that day, Hashem will be One, and His Name One" (ה' אחד ושמו אחד), where there is no distinction between God (His Essence) and His Name (His manifestation). This ultimate state is facilitated by the difficult process culminating in the Tzaddik's Histalkus.
*   **The Final Charge:** "Since we have already gone through all these stages, **now the matter depends only on us – the seventh generation.**"
*   **The Hope:** "And we will merit to see the Rebbe [the Previous Rebbe] here below, in a body, and below ten handbreadths [i.e., fully revealed in this physical world], and he will redeem us."

**In Summary:**

The Rebbe's first Ma'amar takes the Previous Rebbe's final discourse as a starting point and profoundly deepens it. He explains that the ultimate purpose of creation is for God's *Essence* to have a dwelling place specifically in this lowest, physical world. This was the original state ("Ikar Shechina בתחתונים"). Sin caused a withdrawal, primarily the withdrawal from *this* world. The Tzaddikim, culminating in Moshe (the 7th), worked to bring the Shechina back down. The Rebbe identifies his generation as the 7th from the Alter Rebbe, inherently "beloved" and empowered by all the preceding Rebbes. This generation's task, facilitated even by the painful Histalkus of the Previous Rebbe, is to complete the mission: to transform the mundane world through Torah and Mitzvos (Etkafya and Et'hapcha), turning worldly "folly" into holy devotion, thereby drawing God's *Essence* fully into this world and ushering in the final Redemption, a state even higher than before creation. The responsibility, the Rebbe declares, now rests squarely on their shoulders.
